# Struct Emerge
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
My project is a web application that allows you to run an emergent behavior simulator with various options for changing the initial weights.
to be able to make this project I had to do a lot of learning outside of what I learned in cs50 with the main focus revolving around how to take advantage of the pygame library and more fundamental learning around cases of weak emergence and how it can be simulated. 
My inital plan was to rely heavily on boids algorithm(Craig Reynolds 1986) the concepts of which I use throughout my project. I decided that it would be interesting to attempt to not limit the algorithm to flocking behaviors but allow the agents to stick and form structures depending on the initial weights. My hope was that it could be tweaked to form crystaline or snowflake like structures that grew over time depending on how many particles got introduced
Throughout this proccess I changed direction and coding structure multiple times. 
The youtube channel "Clear Code" had a lot of videos about pygame fundamentals and my finished code was heavily influenced by the tutorials he made. Specifically those on how to use the sprites class. I also relied heavily on the pygame documentation for my implimentation of this simulation.
The youtube channel "Coding With Russ" influenced how I implemented rectangle colisions into my sim.
